# Market Sizing

Do enough customers care?

Finding product-market fit is just the first step. Will you be able to build a viable business? One that is large enough and profitable enough to satisfy
- You
- Your investors
- Your other stakeholders

Total available market (TAM)
- Total market demand for a product/service
- Total amount of sales that you could make if you had no competition

Serviceable Available Market (SAM)
- Subset of TAM that a company can reasonably serve
- Geographic, product, technological constraints

Serviceable Obtainable Market
- The subset of SAM that you realistically hope to capture
- Where your value proposition gives you an advantage over the competition
- Your "target market" - the market that you intend to dedicate resources toward capturing

Top-Down and Bottom-Up
- Top-down: uses a broad market size figure and determines the percentage that the Target Market represents
- Bottom-up: Adding up relevant revenue or purhcases of participants in the Target market
- Top down is quicker, but bottom-up can be more valid if the information is available

Sources of information
- Secondary Research
  - Web searches
  - Articles/press releases
  - SEC filings
  - Trade associations
  - Subscription based or sydicated research
- Primary Research
  - Telephone interview
  - On-site interviews
  - Trade shows

Bottom-Up Market Sizing
1. Define your target customers
   - What is their job?
   - Who are they?
   - What motivates them? 
   - Who influences them?
   - Create a **customer archetype**
2. Estimate total number of target customers:
   - How many companies/customers have a similar profile? 
   - Census data, industry databases
   - Web searches
   - Press releases and articles
3. Determine penetrastion rate
   - Estimate the percentage of the toal number of customers who need to buy
   - Mission-critical solutions can expect high penetration rate
   - Non-mission-critical or specialised solutions can expect lower penetration rate
4. Calculate potential market size
   - Potential market volume = number of target vustomers * penetration rate
   - Potential markett value = potential volume * average value (or price)

Importance of Growth
1. Serve a growing market
2. Steal customers away from your competitors

# Industry Analysis

Market opportunity is about more than market size
- How does the industry operate?
- Is it an attractive market in which to compete?
- What part of the industry value chain should you target?

Tools for analysis
- PEST Analysis
  - A framework for identifying factors in an industry that will affect how your business operates
  - Political, Economic, Social and Technological factors
  - External factors outside your control
  - May lead to opportunities, or stifle innovation
  - Political factors
    - Government regulations
    - Tax policies
    - Patent and copyright law
    - Employment laws
    - International trade restrictions 
    - Political stability
  - Economic factors
    - Economic growth
    - Interest rates
    - Inflation
    - Economic instability
  - Social factors
    - Demographics
    - Population growth
    - Education
    - Lifestyle/fashion trends
    - Health consciousness
    - Work/career attitudes
  - Technological factors
    - Gov/industry research spending
    - New inventions
    - Rate of technology transfer
    - Energy use and cost
    - Changes in internet/mobile usage
    - Technology life cycles

Consider how these trends affect your business
- Positive/Negative
- Immediate/Future
- Strong/Weak
- Can you adapt your business/business model to take advantage?

PEST limitations
- External only - does not consider internal environment or competition
- Factors can change - sometimes rapidly
- Best when used in conjunction with other analyses

Five Forces Framework
- Focus on potential profitability
- Driven by bargaining power of suppliers and customers, threats from new entrants and substitutes, and the competitive rivalry within an industry
- An attractive industry for a startup is one wher ethe company can be expected to have the maximum ability to generate good **profit margins**
  - More powerful, more pressure it will pout on prices/costs/both
  - Not necessarily driven by industry growth rates, regulation, technology adoption rates, etc.


Bargaining power of buyers
- If buyers are powerful, they will drive profits down by
  - Demanding lower prices
  - Demanding more value
  - Buyer power is likely to be highest when what they're buying is
    - Undifferentiated
    - Expensive relative to their other inputs
    - Not a major contributor to their own performance

Bargaining power of suppliers
- If suppliers are powerful, they will drive profits down by
  - Charging higher prices
  - Insisting more favorable terms
- Supplier power is likely to be highest when
  - They are large and concetrated relative to a fragmented industry
  - Industry needs them more than they need the industry
  - Customers are undifferentiated
  - Threaten to vertically integrate

Threat of Substitutes
- Products or services that meet the same basic need in a different way
- Caps prices when threat is real and switching cost is low

Threat of New Entrants
- High prices attract competition
- A realistic threat of new entrants forces company to cap prices and/or add value to remain differentiated
- Limited by barriers to entry
  - Economies of scale
  - First-mover advantage
  - Cost of admission (capital investment)
  - Proprietary technology
  - Government regulations

Competitive Rivalry
- If rivalry is intense, competitors often compete away value through
  - Price competition
  - Advertising spending
  - Increased customer service
- Competitive Rivalry is likely to be most intense when
  - Industry is fragmented
  - Industry growth is slow
  - High exit barriers
  - Competitiors are undifferentiated
  - Products are "perishable"

Industry Mapping
- Plot the entire value chain from supplier to consumers
- Examine the relationships of each link in the cahain
- Identify how your value proposition could be designed for maximum advantage at various points
