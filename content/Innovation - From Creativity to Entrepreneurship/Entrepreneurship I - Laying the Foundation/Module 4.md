- A startup is not a business
- It is a group looking for a viable business model
- Business model assumptions must be challenged
  - By talking to customers and partners
  - By observing their behavior
  - By conducting experiments

Getting direct feedback from customers to confirm or deny your assumptions about
- Value proposition
- Customer segment 
- Channels 
- Customer relationships
- Revenue model

Assumptions

- Other solutions are not optimal because ___
- They will adopt my solution if it does ___
- The best way for me to reach my target customers is ___
- The best price for me to charge is ___
- Customers will be receptive to a ___ revenue model
- The key risks that I will face will be ___

> Assumptions can only be confirmed or denied with facts

Customer Discovery Goals
- To confirm a product-market fit between customer's need and the solution you have identified
- To understand the key features that your solution must include to be of value to your customer
- To determine the best way for you to market, price and sell your solution

Getting Started
- Identify key assumptions about your customers
  - Who are your typical customers?
  - How many of them are there?
  - Who are your early adopter customers?
  - How important is the problem that you have identified?
  - How eager are they to find a solution?
  - What features are needed in order for a solution to be workable?
  - Where would they be likely to look for a solution?
  - Who/what would influence their decision?

Getting Interviews
- Avoid interviewing people that you know
- Ask for referrals
- Go to where your customers are
- Conferences and trade shows
- Meet-ups
- Ambush strangers
- Ask for advice
- Play the student/researcher card
- LinkedIn/Alumni networks
- Gatekeepers/executive assistants
- Landing page

Asking Questions
- Start by describing the purpose of the interview
- Ask them to describe the problem in their own words
  - How does the problem affect you?
  - How often do you have the problem?
  - What solutions have you tried?
  - How critical is the problem?
  - What features are necessary?
  - Where do you expect to purchase it?
  - What should I have asked you that I didn't?

Customer Discovery Tips
- In person, one-on-one meetings are best
- Ask open-ended questions
- Ask them to share their stories
- Listen carefully and observe their responses
- Have someone with you to take notes
- Don't describe your solution too soon

MVP
- A simple, stripped down version of your product
- Enough for customers to use, interact to provide feedback on
- Ideally something that they can pay for
- Used to obtain feedback about product-market fit and to guide future development
- It might not be a product at all

MVPs in Customer Discovery
- Don't present the solution until you understand the problem
- Tell them that you want them to be honest
- Ask if they would be willing to pay for it

Drawing Conclusions
- Talk to enough custonmers
- Take good notes
- Use quantitative measures
- Look for patterns not outliers

# Early Adopters

- Paying customers are the difference between a startup concept and a startup business
- Early adopters are liekly to be your first customers

- They are technical leaders
- They want to gain a competittive edge
- They're willing to use a product that is not yet complete
- They like to be the first to use a new product

To be an early adopter, a customer must be able to pay for your solution
- They understand the value of your solution
- Price should not be the key issue
- They may be willing to pay extra for early access
- A free trial is only a sale after it converts to paid

- A startup can achieve initial success by designing their solutions specificcally for early adopters
- They may be willing to purchase a solution that is not yet ready for the larger market
- They can provide feedback to help guide developpment of additional features
- They may be willing to **pay extra for early access**

Finding Early Adopters
- Start with personal/professional networks
- Who do you know that has the problem?
- If you can't find people right away, then
  - Your business concept is probably not viable
  - You are not the right person to lead the business
- Ask your contacts for referrals
- Find the **watering holes**
  - Where early adopters hang out
  - For work or for pleasure
  - Online and offline

Influencers
- Look for the influencers at these watering holes
  - The people that people are talking to or about
  - The people who are deemed to be the experts
  - The people who have the strongest networks

One way to access industry experts is to become one yourself
- Comment constructively on others' posts/advice
- Offer advice and solutions (without selling)
- Start your own blog
- Publish white papers and case studies

Sharing your roadmap
- Early adopters may be willing to try a product that is not yet complete, but need to understand your vision for the full solution
- They can provide valuable feedback
- They may ask for discounts
- They may ask for exclusivity

How many early adopters do you need?
- Depends on the nature and price of your solution
  - If it is big, expensive solution, you may only need one
  - If it's small and cheap, you may need hundreds
  - If it's free, you may need thousands
