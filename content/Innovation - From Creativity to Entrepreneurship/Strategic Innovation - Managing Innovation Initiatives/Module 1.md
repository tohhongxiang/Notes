# Challenges in the Evolution of New Technologies and Markets

The S-curve
- Technology starts off relatively low
    - Dominant design not clear
    - Competition over design
    - Extensive experimentation
    - Multiple configurations
    - Uncertain and dynamic
- Period of rapid increase in performance, also a time when the market is rapidly growing (Point of crossing the chasm)
- Market performance levels out (Market is mature)

### Strategic choices
- Timing of entry
    - Enter early
    - But too early can be premature
- Magnitude of commitment
    - High commitment wins
    - But high commitment can lock in early mistakes
- Link to or separate from existing organization
    - Leverage existing capabilities
    - Efforts can inhibit adaptations
- Follow well-established recipes

Markets have uncertainty and dynamism. There is no simple recipe to succeed in the market

### How Organizations Succeed and Fail as Markets Grow and Change

Addressing decisions effectively
- Develop strong customer value propositions
- Understand requirements as market develops

How to implement a strategy effectively?
- Design the organization around that strategy
- Alignment (Mutually supporting components)

Key elements
1. Strategy
    - Key success factors
    - Critical tasks to succeed at
2. Structures and Systems
    - Functional structures vs division/business units
    - Centralization vs decentralization
    - Measurements and rewards
3. People
    - Who to hire? 
    - Competencies
    - How to motivate?
4. Culture
    - Shared expectations on what and how things works
    - Values/beliefs/norms

Alignment develops over time
- Managers work to fine-tune alignment based on their learning from the market
    - Build better systems
    - Adjust rewards 
    - Hire just the right people
- People in the organisation come to see what leads to success and failure
    - Both for the organization and themselves
    - Culture is shaped by history

Inertia
- Over time, as alignment and fit improve, we build more inertia
- It takes more energy to change alignment

Structural vs Cultural Alignment
- Structural
    - Practices/Structures/Systems
    - People become invested in these practices
    - People actively try to preserve these elements
- Cultural/Cognitive Inertia
    - Occurs in peoples' minds
    - People actively preserve organizational beliefs
    - View current approach as functional
    - Identify with beliefs over time

# Ambidextrous Organizations
As an organisation, we should be able to 
1. Compete in a mature market - Focus on cost efficiency, incremental innovation, dynamic competition
2. Develop new products and enter new markets - radical innovation, moving quickly, being flexible

Firms are good at identifying opportunites to leverage existing assets and capabilities

How do we effectively execute?
- Organize new business initiative as a separate entity
- Provide senior management support to integrate efforts and preven mainstream business from undermining the new effort

Sometimes its hard to transfer resources to support a new innovation
- Uncertainty in the gains of the new innovation
- Certainty that diverting resources from the mainstream business will definitely cause a loss
- Losses loom larger than gains
- Mainstream businesses have more reputable and powerful executives that will control how much resources to invest into a new innovation

The mainstream business might undermine the new innovation because
1. New business may be hindered by inertia arising from mainstream businesses' systems/culture/norms
2. New business may be portrayed as a threat/distraction from the mainstream business
3. Mainstream business has a voracious appeitite for resources

- Inertia from mainstream business will hinder efforts to design a new organisation. 
- The new organisation needs different structures, systems, rewards etc. that can execute the new business strategy
- The old organisation will have to be convinced at every step of the way why its succesful design is not appropriate

Form numerous, semi-autonomous, small units to gain responsiveness and innovation
- Each unit can align around the particular parameters that it faces - what customers expect, what margins are, speed vs. quality for instance
- More tightly linked approaches are usually not enough

We also need to integrate these small units together
- Integration mechanisms to maintain access to rresources and capabilities
- Integration through how units are placed and conceptualized within organizational architecture
- Integration on how people are placed, particularly executives

Enable differential alignment through separation, but maintain some integration as well

Two routes to ambidexterity
1. Separated businesses
2. Extensive senior management support

# Leading Ambidextrous Organizations
What is the strategic intent?
What is the company's identity?

Establish a strategic intent and identity that
- Makes clear the need for success in the existing businesses as well as the new businesses
- Validates the need for experimentation and innovation
- Brings together old and the new, acts as a soft integrating mechanism

In today's business environment, even large firms do not have a long, assured lifetime.

Cultural challenge from ambidexterity
- We want strong cultures that promote cohesion across the firm
- But the culture that fits a mature business is often different than a culture that fits a new venture

Loose tight culture
- Certain core values are shared companywide

Why is leadership important?
Things need to change, and leadership is the linchpin behind change
- Win the mainstream
- Win the innovation

Key leadership challenges
1. Engage around intent and identity that unites innovation and mainstream
2. Resolve tensions and confront conflict between innovation and mainstream
3. Be consciously inconsistent toward innovation and mainstream
4. Build in times and places for core leadership tasks

Frame the leadership challenge itself. Decide where to exert leadership around differences. Act inconsistently.
