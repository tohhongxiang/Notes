| Wanted by a firm's existing mainstream customers | Potentially valuable capabilities, but not capabilities that the firm's existing customers want |

# Responding to Disruptive Technologies
NOT  a failure to recognize or explore disruptive technology

Marketing perpective
- Dictum to stay close to existing customers
- Misses potential of new technology early on

Resource Allocation
- New markets are small, low-margin and uncertain
- Unattractive to traditional plannign systems

Responding effectively to disruptive technologies
- Recognize possibility that new technology can be disruptive
    - Talk to the right people (engineers, not marketeers/financiers)
- Ask about feasible market-technology intersection
    - Find where market and technology intersect, raather than looking to your customers' views or technology comparisons
- Locate the intial market
    - Use non-traditional means (startups, skunk works) rather than traditional channels (customers, market research)

- One that is flexible, hungry, lean - that does not see lower-margin market as unattractive
- Keep it indepenedent to avoid debilitating political battles
- Able to respond quickly and find new customers

Threat
- New market as an opportunity vs new market as a threat

# Effective Management of Innovation Streams
Capabilities
- Something an organization can do well
- Resources
    - Tangible and intangible valuable assets
    - Human talent, sophisticated equipment, product designs etc.
- Processes
    - How people in the organisation get work done - e.g. marketing and sales have processes to find and secure customers
    - Processes exist in all functions
    - Processes also create inertia
- Values
    - The 'software' of the organisation
    - Defines how decisions get made
    - Values about what gross margins are acceptable
        - Reflects busness model and overhead costs that the company has built into its structure
    - What size the business needs to be interesting
        - Larger companies usually lose the ability to address small, emerging markets

Building new processes
- Organisational space to do things in a new way
- Bring in new values

Building capabilities
- Independent organisation
    - Referred to as "Spin out"
    - Implies a complete separation from teh main organisational structure
- Heavyweight team
- Acquisition

Fit with Organisation's Values
 | Good (Sustaining Innovation) | Poor (Disruptive Innovation)                                        |
 | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
 | Poor                         | Use heavyweight team within existing organisation                   | use a heavyweight team in a separate spinout organisation                                                         |
 | Good                         | Use lightweight or functional team within the existing organisation | Development may occur in-house through a heavyweight team, but commercialisation almost alwyas requires a spinout |

Acquisitions
- Hard to win
- Market uncertainty remains
- How to keep resources and integrate with the firm

# Corporate Entrepreneurship

Firm relies on and enable employees to build new businesses that leverage resources of the parent firm

Generates internal growth

- Extend range of tools we have for building innovative firm
- Adds additional options
- Conceptual framework and four ideal-type models

Opportunist approach
- How firms start; responsibility and funding is diffused and ad hoc
- Ideas bubble up within business units, and employees find sponsorship within unit leadership and senior management
- Not dependable, ideas dont always fit well into business units' existing strategies and markets

Enabler approach
- Support employees across the organisation to enable development of new concepts
- Executive council that employee teams apply to for receiving executive attention and funding

Advocate approach
- Established corporate group facilitates corporate entrepreneurship in business units
- Corporate group as consultants that travel among business units, helping teams within the business units to develop ideas
- Evangelizes ideas

Producer approach
- Responsible for entire corporate entrepreneurship process and has resources from corporate
- Full service group as opposed to team formed around a task
- Works on ideas directly, from conception to development of the new business

Motivation
- Corporate entrepreneurship as a process encourages entrepreneurial individuals to bring ideas to fruition within the firm, leveraging its resources
- Serendipitous connections through an opportunistic approach are often not strong or reliable enough

Responsibility and Resources
- Where lies the responsibility for corporate entrepreneurship?
- Where do resources come from?

Requirements
- Significant commitments, sustained effort and ability among leaders to navigate political and cultural landscape of a firm
- Emphasis on the informal dimensions of innovation
