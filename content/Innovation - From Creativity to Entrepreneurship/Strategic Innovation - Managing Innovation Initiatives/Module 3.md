# Product Development Teams, Including "Heavyweight" Teams

Why are teams used in innovation projects?
- uncertainty
- Integration of different capabiliities
    - How to effectively manage and coordinate the work of a team whose members are based in different functions and who have different expertise, expectations, systems and routines
    
Key Design Elements of Teams
- Compelling goals
- Leaders with team perspective
- Clear membership
- Enabling structures (rewards, support)

Types of Teams
- Functional
- Lightweight
- Heavyweight
- Autonomous

Functional Team
- Traditional team
- Team for each function, managed by a functional manager
- Advantages
    - Bring deep and specialized expertise to bear on the problems at hand
    - Aligns authority, responsibility and reward
- Disadvantages
    - No cross-linking between functions
    - Weak coordination and integration between functions
    - Inflexible way of thinking - each function might think about their past successes and apply old solutions rather than thinking how to conceive a new model
    - Nobody "owns" the overall project, lack commitment

Lightweight Team
- Same structure as functional team, except adding a lightweight **Project Manager** to the team, and a **Liason** for each of the functional teams
- Project Manager helps with coordination/integration between functions
- Project Manager cannot make key decisions - No control of resources
- Advantages
    - Members remain in functional areas
    - Retains many advantages of functional team model
    - Improved coordination and communication
- Disadvantages
    - Expected improvements in coordination and communication are often not achieved
    - Project manager is a "lightweight" with limited status and influence
    - Project manager cannot make key decisions, only influences functional manager

Heavyweight Team
- Same as lightweight team
- Project manager is a **heavyweight** project manager
- Project manager now has direct access and primary responsibility for all the people involved in the project
- Functional managers still responsible for a longer-term career development evaluation and performance appraisal, but heavyweight project manager often has some say in the performance evaluation
- Teams have full ownership for bringing product from concept to market
- Teams are now accountable to senior management in general
- Advantage
    - Due to teams having high ownership, they have high commitment to the project
    - High integrity and integration of development efforts
    - Better chance of coming up with solutions to break inertia
- Disadvantages
    - May conflict with functional organisations
    - May not end up drawing on the full functional expertise that an organisation has, due to a tendency to keep things within the team
    - Raises questions about senior management influence and control
    - Requries major change in team members' work approach from narrow to broad

Autonomous Team 
- Take people out of the functional teams
- Formally assign them and dedicate them and co-locate them with the project team
- Project leader is the sole evaluator of team members contributions, responsible for bringing an idea from concept to market
- Independent of functional organisation
- Advantages
    - Provides focus on project success
    - Efficient cross-functional integration
    - Team members are accountable for results
    - "Clean sheet of paper": Not required to follow existing practices since puled out of functional organisation
- Disadvantages
    - Difficult to control various teams
    - May duplicate resources and have trouble drawing on organisation capabilities

# Focus on Using "Heavyweight" Product Development Teams

Key differences between cross-functional (heavyweight) team and functional team

| Issue                             | Cross-Functional Team                                      | Functional Team                                     |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Team's Charter                    | Board and Dynamic: Responsible for product                 | Narrow and pre-specified                            |
| Orientation of Core Members       | Think like general manager                                 | Functional specialist                               |
| Project Ownership                 | Within Team                                                | Diffused                                            |
| Integration                       | Interactive within Team                                    | Sequential across functions (or by senior managers) |
| Source of Expertise and Resources | Team co-located, functions, supply expertise and resources |
| Success is                        | Product success                                            | Best Practice used                                  |
| Accountable to                    | Senior management                                          | Functional boss                                     |

Teams and innovation
1. The leader is the ultimate owner of the project
    - Has to be the concept champion who advocates for it both up and down the organisation
    - Has to be the guardian of its integrity when choices are made in different functions and levels
    - Requires strong communication and confluct resolution skills
    - High commitment and credibility
2. Has to be comfortable in different functional areas
    - May not be fluent, but required to be capable of speaking the language of multiple functions
    - Typically needs to be able to lead the engineering work directly
    - Also has to be able to take a market and customer perspective and bring this perspective to the engineering or operations side with confidence and conviction
3. Active
    - Complex demanding and stressful to the organisation
    - High level of information flow and uncertainty. Leader has to be out of the office, face to face with key participants, communication, identifying and resolving conflicts etc.

Executive Sponsorship
- The executive sponsor is a channel to communicate between executive team and heavyweight teams
- Acts as an advocate and a liason for the heavyweight team
- Prevents executives from having to talk to each heavyweight team individually, preventing mixed signals
- Clarifies areas where the team is empowered to make decisions as oppsoed to executive leadership being very involved
- Executive leadership often is concerned with maintaning close control of resource commitments, incentive rewards, pricing etc. Also maintaining visibility of milestone achievement and schedule slips
- Clarity in these areas helps teams move forward in a way that avoids violations of expectations and maintains confidence of executive leadership
- Different way of relating to executive team. One that empowers the team, reduces the likelihood of debilitating conflict and variable support from executives in different functional areas. Still provides the accountability and control that executive team needs

Team member roles and responsibilities
- Core team members are responsible for the functional areas **and** for performance of the project as a whole
- Required to take an executive view
- Team members can vary sharply in their comfort with the idea of putting on a **team hat**. Therefore coaching and development is critical

# Innovation through Partnerships Between Dedicated Teams and Functional Groups

Execution is under emphasised. Managers recognize their strategy must encompass innovation, but management tools to push innovation forward are limited.

Innovation = Ideas + Motivation
- Provide incentives, celebrate innovation success, build a culture of innovation

Innovation = Ideas + Process
- Copmpanies that confront repeated innovation build detailed processes that guide execution

Mainstream organisation "Performance Engine" are built to be
- Repeatable
- Predictable

However, it tends to stumble on complex innovations, where initiatives are
- Non-routine
- Unpredictable

Hence for innovation we must do things differently
- Custom Organisational Model (Design-processes, culture, etc)
- Custom Plan (Goals, measurement, accountability)

**Team** is a custom organisation and in a partnership
**Plan** includes goals, metrics, accountability designed around challenging innovation initiatives

# Building the Dedicated Team and Managing the Partnership

Dedicated Team
1. What is the team's scope?
2. How to build the team
3. How is the partnership managed?

1. The team's scope
    - What to split out and what to share within the mainstream organisation
    - Tendency to overestimate mainstream organisation capabilities - Underscoping the dedicated team
    - Too focused on individuals and talents
    - Should focus on relationships between groups and functions (How they communicate, differences in power etc.)

    | Reason for separation                                           | Explanation                                                                                                      | Example                                                                                                |
    | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
    | Lack of needed work relationships between units and individuals | Building new relationships takes time and effort, pressed out by demands of mainstream organisation              | New product architecture: BMW splits out regenerative braking initiative for hybrid car                |
    | Power structure doesn't fit needs of innovation intitiative     | Power is depely embedded in relationships and work, need to create a new context if power structure is to change | Need to compete in a new way: Electrolux splits out customer insight teams to develop high-end markets |
    | Operational tempo doesn't fit innovation opportunity            | Tempo is built in to planning and evaluation processes, difficult to work against                                | Need extensive exploration: Timnberland splits out trail shoe development                              |

2. How to build the team
    - Who is on the team?
        - Define needed skills, hire the best people
            - Make sure to avoid bias towards insiders (due to pride, familiarity etc.)
            - Danger of skill deficit and more importantly, recreating existing perspectives, power structures, and processes
        - However, dedicated team has to work differently than employees are used to
        - Due to new work relationships, power structures, etc. are needed
    - What is its design and mode of operation?
        - Avoid bias towards drawing on components from the mainstream organisation because it is expedient, familiar etc.
        - Recreates old roles and responsibilities
        - Reinforces dominance of old power centers
        - Assesses performance using established measures
        - Fails to create distinct culture
        - Uses existing (inappropriate) processes
        - Tyranny of conformance to systems and standards
        - Solution: Design dedicated team with a clean sheet of paper. Conscious redesign of each component, and
            - Rebalance power by strategically hiring outsiders and choosing most powerful insider to fit the needs of the new initiative
            - Gain executive support to break from systems and standards

3. How is the partnership managed?
    - Positive persuasive collaborative leadership style
    - Managing dedicated teams
        - Gain formal access to resources
        - Gain attention from individual people
        - Manage conflicts
    - Most important thing is **senior leadership**
        - Most critical day-to-day role of senior executive; Suppoort team leader in efforts to make the partnership work
        - Many executives involved only at initial/approval stage, when initiative is tiny
        - Rquires ongoing involvment to mediate conflicts and decision-making

Challenges for making teams and innvations
- Competition for scarce resources
- Divided attention of shared staff
- Disharmony in partnership
