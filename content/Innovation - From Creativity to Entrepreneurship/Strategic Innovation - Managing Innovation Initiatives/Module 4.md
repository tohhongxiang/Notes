# Introduction to Planning and Evaluation for Innovation: The Importance of Experimentation and Learning

Challenging innovation initiatives - High uncertainty

Planning and Evaluation
- When innovation is the central achallenge, these parts of management need to be much more oriented towards experimentation and learning

Learning and Leadership
- Emphasize the importance of learning
- Try to build it in to the culture
- Make sure you create a safe space for risk taking

Challenges in Learning 
- Complex situation
    - People are good at learning in simple situations
        - When cause and effect are easily visible
        - When actions clearly lead to outcomes that provide clear feedback
    - People are bad at learning in complex situations
        - When feedback is incomplete, delayed, ambiguous
        - Connections between actions and outcomes only become clear after large investments
- Valuing it as a Central Goal
    - Managers and executives are used to valuing results
    - Executives may see learning as a "squishy" goal
    - Planning systems are typically set up to produce results
    - Learning must be a compoelling goal and part of the planning process

If results are below target, 
| Learning-oriented Firm                                                  | Results-oriented Firm                                                      |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Prompts re-examining assumptions                                        | Appears as a failure                                                       |
| Revise future predictions based on new data                             | Lowering targets is frowned upon                                           |
| Perhaps not an attractive opportunity                                   | Leader will want to present ways to "recover" the plan                     |
| Embrace "fail-fast" ethos if we learn the opportunity is not attractive | Pressure to go harder in the same direction rather than changing direction |

The firm that learns the fastest will win in challenging innovation situations

Learning emerges as a goal -> Establish experiments as the method and the metaphor to achieve that goal

Planning for Innovation Initiatives Over Time
- Need to iterate, experiment, learn adn adjust at a fast pace
- Establish fast review cycle
- Separate planning forums for innovative initiatives, with different orientation and tempo
- Discuss data and assumptions
- Focus on trends and revise predictions
- Revisions to cause and effect model through formal process
- Use cause and effect model as the central anchor in the planning process

> We build experimentation and learning in to the fabric of the innovation initiative, but in a programmed and planned way that is familiar to those who live in results-oriented environments

Evaluation
- Central to the "control" function of management
- Involves gathering and interpreting data
- Confirm or revise the cause-and-effect model

Why are we falling short?
| Outcomes too low | Predictions too high |
| ---------------- | -------------------- |
| Poor execution   | Poor assumptions     |

Makes it harder for firm to learn and adjust to what is actually happening. Bias becomes simply working harder, but in the same direction

The bias toward concluding shortfall is result of company's poor execution is the "Most omnipresent and dangerous enemy of innovation"

Where does this bias come from?
- A product of established operations
- Idea of "Performance Culture" 
    - Managers are judged on performance relative to outcomes
    - Revising forecases down is akin to defeat
- Appropriate only when you can make reliable predictions

Need an alternative system to take into account this bias

Accountability for learning
- Did the leader take planning seriously -rather than disengaging from the plan?
- Did the leader maintain and update a cause-effect model, through an evidence based process?
- Did predictions get better, especially for critical unknowns?
- Did the leader make sure the **team** understood the model and the critical unknowns, that the team reacted to new information promptly, and that the team maintained a learning mindset?

# Innovation Across Firm Boundaries: Virtual Firms, Alliances and more
- Alliances
- Joint Ventures
- Open Innovation
- User-driven Innovation

Make-or-buy decision and innovation
- New technologies and markets are uncertain and dynamic
- Working with other firms offers the promise of greater responsiveness to changing markets and technologies
- Concerns about coordination, information sharing and control arise that can undercut those benefits

Joint ventures and alliances
- Firms agree to cooperate with other firms through sharing specific resources and setting up some type of separate organisation
- Shared equity between firms

Contractual agreements
- Other firms act as suppliers, but supplier and buyer firms work together closely to develop new products and services
- Capitalise on joint capabilities

"Virtual" approach to organising
- Innovating through building a virtual firm
- Independent firms act as a coherent system
- An innovation system in this case

Why a virtual approach?
- Resources
    - Firms can pool their resources and capabilities to access opportunities that would be relatively inaccessible for a single firm
- Ability to take risk
    - Independent firms characterised by taking more risks, moving faster, and working harder to succeed in a new market

Autonomous innovations
- The innovation can be independent of others
- The interface between different components is relatively standardised and codified
- Less need for coordination and information sharing, so the virtual approach becomes more attractive

Systemic Innovation
- Innovations are more interdependent
- Integration has an advantage
- Great deal of coordination and sharing of sensitive information needed
- Hard to gain thecommitment and trust required in a virtual system

Control of technological direction and ability to capture value
- Integrated firms can make decisions that connect these 2 factors
- In a virtual system, each firm is making them on its own
- An individual firm may lose that control or ability to capture value

| Capabilities required\Types of innovation | Autonomous             | Systemic          |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------- |
| ...exist outside                          | Virtual                | Ally with caution |
| ...must be created                        | Ally or bring in-house | Bring in-house    |

Takeaways
- Using **only** virtual approach is high-risk
- Use hybrid of virtual and integrated organisation to have staying power
- Be at the center of a network, leveraging your own capabilities

# Managing Innovative Initiatives: The Case of Alliances and Joint Ventures (JV)

- At least half fail to achieve their objectives
- Many failures occur not becuase of flawed strategy, but becuase it failed in implementation\

Why is implementation problematic?
- Misalignment in strategic goals
- Problems sharing needed resources
- Difficulties gaining commitment by employees involved
- Lack of trust between employees in different parent firms

Alliances and JVs are often under-designed and there is insufficient attention to organistaion building

Recommendations 
- Go **further** as part of the deal-making process
    - Develop strong, detailed business paln
    - Key issues in product direction and marketing can be resolved in advance
    - These issues might completely stall the alliance if alignment is only achieved at a surface level
- Make strong effort to identify shared resources and interdependencies and reach shared understanding of how these will be handled
    - Minimise unneeded interdependencies as part of the process
    - Having control of resources for innovatoin efforts is central
    - Recall magnetic pull mainstream efforts have on resources; here the mainstream is the parent firms' own efforts
- Think through and streamline decision-making beyond contractual mechanisms
    - Agree where the alliance or JV will have autonomy and where it will not
    - Where it will not, how the decisions will actually be made in practice

Organisation Building
1. Attract key talented people
   1. Start with leadership
2. Set clear expectations on commitment
3. Build in incentives to make key players comfortable in the new venture
