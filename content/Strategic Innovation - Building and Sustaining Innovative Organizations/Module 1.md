# Module 1

# What is innovation?
- The coming up of new ideas
- Improving existing ideas
- Thinking differently
- Recombinant innovation - Combining existing knowledge in new ways

# Where do innovators get their ideas from?
- Everywhere
- Problems that they face daily
- Problems other people face daily
- Account for the **business ecosystem**

# How do people make choices about whether to use a new product/service?
- Benefits of using new product that old product does not provide
- Cost of switching from existing product/service to new product
- The best product is usually one that minimises losses

# Does the best product or innovation win out? Why?
- Usually the best product wins. Lowest cost/highest benefits
- Should aim towards **consumer needs**, not wants

# How would you describe the benefits that your innovation provides?
- Reduce time spent on a problem
- Increase reliability
- Reduce effort required

# What is a customer value proposition? How would you draw a diagram of one? What makes a winning one?
- What is the value we provide? (Needs)
- Who are we trying to reach? (Segment)
- How are we reaching them? (Channels)

# Developing a value proposition
- Value perceived by consumers is a key to a successful value proposition
    - How do companies create value for customers?
    - How do companies capture value back from customers?
- Value = quality obtained/price paid
- Companies that can value create and value capture will survive long term

# Minimizing Loss and Maximizing Gain with Prospect Theory

- Prospect theory refers to how people make choices
- Value vs outcome
- Prospect theory consists of 3 segments
    1. Reference points
    2. Diminishing sensitivity
    3. Losses loom larger than gains

## Reference points
- The intersection of value and outcome is the consumers' **reference point**
    - For example, \$0.50 for a drink is acceptable for me, because that is my reference point
    - If the next day, the drink costs \$1.00, I would say it is unfair, because I get the same outcome for a higher price
- A reference point is subjective
    - If I said that John is 6"3'  tall in a normal context, you would agree he is tall
    - However, if I said John is an NBA player who is 6"3' tall, you would say he is short for an NBA player, because the average height of an NBA player is 6"4'
- The left of the outcome is a **loss**, while the right of the outcome is a **gain**
    - Positive outcome = gain, negative outcome = loss
    - Every product is a bundle of gains and losses - consumers make tradeoffs
    - Consumers evaluate gains and losses to decide whether to use a product
- Prospect theory applies not just to consumers, but to companies as well

## Diminishing Sensitivity
- Law of diminishing marginal utility
- The difference between \$5 and \$10 vs \$1000 and \$1005
- The objective difference is the same, but the subjective value between \$5 - \$10 is a lot higher than between \$1000 - \$1005
- Applies to developing products for consumers as well
    - The first few features have a significant impact on the value of the product
    - However as features are being added, the relative value that each feature adds gets smaller and smaller (Diminishes psychological value)

## Losses loom larger than gains
- The pain intensity of a loss is larger than the satisfaction from a gain
- The loss of \$20 is a lot worse than the happiness from finding \$20
- In the loss domain (negative outcomes), users are **risk-seeking**, but users are **risk-averse** in the gains domain because users want to keep the benefits

# Endowment Effect
- The irrational tendency to overvalue things that we own
- Consumers implicitly overvalue existing products over new products
- Companies implicitly overvalue new products they produce
- Collision in perspectives from companies and consumers
- Endowment effect intensifies the longer the ownership

> The best product does not win out in the marketplace. The product that best minimizes the losses and satisfies the needs of the consumers will win in the long run

# Crafting a Customer Value Proposition (CVP)
- A CVP consists of 3 main questions
    1. What value does the offering deliver?
        - Bundle of benefits (What benefits does your product offer?)
        - Pain points (Does the product solve the problems of existing solutions?)
        - Points of difference (How does the product differentiate itself from existing solutions?)
    2. Who is the target segment?
    3. How are we reaching the segment(s)?
        - What channels are used to reach the segments? Retailers, directly to consumers, distributors etc.

For example, the value proposition of a taxi is **to take a passenger to their destination**. For existing call-for-hire cabbies, there is a worry that 
- Cab driver doesn't arrive on time
- Passenger does not know where the cab driver is

However,
- The physical/psychological safety of the passenger is ensured (since it is usually government-controlled)

Consider Uber. Uber addresses the pain points of call-for-hire cabbies
- The user knows an estimated time for how long the driver takes before he arrives
- The user will know where exactly the cab driver is at any point in time

When choosing a segment to target, you don't have to always target the masses. Targeting niche markets, which usually have smaller supplies, can also be good due to less competition and relatively higher demands
