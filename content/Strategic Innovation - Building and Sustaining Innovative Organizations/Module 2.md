# Module 2

# Innovation Adoption Lifecycle
- When an innovation is adopted, not all consumers adopt at the same time
- Some adopt early, some late, some never
- The innovation lifecycle consists of 5 stages
    1. Innovators (2.5%)
    2. Early adopters (13.5%)
    3. Early majority (34%)
    4. Late majority (34%)
    5. Laggards (16%)

# Take-off Point
- Point of rapid growth 
- Based on **sales** (sales take-off point) or **number of firms** (firm take-off)

# Sales Takeoff Points
- Modern products take off a lot faster than previously
- The tipping point or takeoff on a product lifecycle is known as the **sales takeoff**
- Signifies the transition to becoming a "mass-market" product
- The product lifecycle:
    1. Introduction
    2. Growth (Usually where the sales takeoff occurs)
    3. Maturity
    4. Decline

# Firm Takeoff Points
- Firm lifecycle:
    1. Commercial introduction
    2. Sharp increase in number of firms (Firm takeoff)
    3. Gradual plateau
    4. Decline in number of firms (shake out)
    5. Number of firms remain stable
- Firm takeoff occurs when there is a sharp increase in the number of firms
- Collaboration is important in the early evolution of any industry
- Usually, firm takeoff happens before sales takeoff for an industry to be successful

# Mapping Performance and Expectations in an Innovation Context
- Performance against time
- Performance refers to 
    - The storage capacity of a hard drive
    - The processing speed of a computer chip
    - Etc.
- Plot the expected performance trajectory against time (Market need trajectory)
- In the beginning, the actual performance is usually less than expected (Undershooting)
    - Usually lower costs, but worse performance
- However, after firm takeoff point, the performance exponentially grows
- When actual performance intersects expected market performance, sales takeoff occurs
    - The intersection point is where the mass market is
- Actual performance continues to grow, but gradually plateaus (Overshooting)
    - Higher performance, but at higher costs which are passed down to consumers

# Basis of Competition
- The dominant industry attribute
- Segment-specific
- E.g. **Purity** of insulin, **Functionality** of a car etc.
- When overshooting, the company offers more on the attribute than what the consumers expect
    - Increases costs that are passed on to consumers
    - Creates **feature-bloat** for products
    - Marginal benefits from the over-shot product may not be worth the increase in price
    - If only one company has overshot, there is no problem (Due to lack of competition)
    - If multiple companies overshoot, then pricing pressures occur, especially if a company decides to compete on price. Leads to **commodotization**
        - Consumers think that all the products are the same, hence only decide based on price
    - If a company overshoots, they should aim to change the basis of competition

# Types of Innovation
- Product innovation
- Process innovation
    - Companies become more effecient
    - Usually occurs after standardization
    - Wrings costs out of the system and serve consumers in a cost effective way
- Incremental innovation
    - When consumers buy a product they usually zero in on one attribute, or a pre ordered set of attributes
    - Incremental innovation refers to a gentle jump of the dimension that matters most to consumers
- Radical innovation
    - Similar to incremental, but it is a drastic jump
- Disruptive innovation
    - Innovation that disrupts an industry
    - Amazon (Online retailer) vs Borders (Brick and mortar bookstore)
    - Disruptive innovations usually have poor initial quality and caters to a niche market. However over time, the niche market grows into a mass market
- Business model innovation
    - Changing business model as a form of innovation
    - For example, the selling of power tools
    - Consumers are responsible for the maintenance of spare parts and inventory for their tools
    - A company that sells power tools can change their business from a product-oriented to a service-oriented business

### Dominant Design
- During innovation, there are multiple competing designs
- Only one architecture becomes the standard in the long run
- The design that wins is the **dominant design**
    - QWERTY keyboards are the dominant design compared to DVORAK
