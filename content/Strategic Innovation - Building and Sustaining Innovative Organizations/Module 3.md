# Developing Winning Products

# Crossing Over to Mass Market Dominance
- In the early market, it is full of technology curious explorers. No pain point, MVP is OK, forgiving.
- When a product does not transition from early adopters to the early majority, we say that the product has **fallen into the chasm**
- To cross the chasm, the product must transition from an imperfect product to a perfect product
    - Identify a beachhead segment, a segment for whom your product is going to be perfectly ok
    - When developing a product, identify the pain points that the beachhead segment has regarding your product, and focus on fixing them
    - When the beachhead segment is satisfied, they can provude word-of-mouth to encourage other segments into taking up your product
